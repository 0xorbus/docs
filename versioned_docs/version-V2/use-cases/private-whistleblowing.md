More recently, Lai Ying Tong, Brendan Graetz, Barnabé Monnot, myself, and others built a simple whistleblowing application using Semaphore as an entry to the Yale Open Climate Collaboration. One of the goals of the hackerthon was to explore ways that smart contract technology can lead to better accounting and reporting of climate emissions. Our work built on the concept of using economic incentives to encourage executives of carbon-emitting corporations to blow the whistle if their company submits fraudulent data. A trusted referee would investigate such reports, and if they were to find evidence of incorrect reports, they would confiscate a deposit which the company locked up using a smart contract.

Semaphore allows the whistleblower to remain anonymous and prevent retaliation. The way it works is as such: each executive registers their identity into a smart contract. Every day, the company submits climate data, deposits some funds, and adds a unique identifier of the dataset as an external nullifier in the contract. When a whistleblower submits a report, they broadcast a signal to the external nullifier associated with said dataset. This freezes the company’s deposits, pending the referee’s intervention. The whistleblower also receives a reward.
